This will probably serve to store some files, code ect. Perhaps I will upload my code for the Python for Everyone (PY4E) Coursea 
class I recently finished. Also maybe a project I have in the works once it gets more complex or just if I feel the need to upload
it or anything else. I will try to put together material to help (hopefully not cheat) anyone thinking about Charels Severence's 
class (the python course sponsored by U of M. Only a few exist may test the IBM one out before continuing with more of these
courses. It was very helpful as being self taught and a begginer for almost a year. Don't bother with anything unless I edit this
it will be waste your time, trust me.
