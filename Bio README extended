#  Notice how earth.shape printed the global Obolate Sheroid
#  Then notice how using the class PLANET  in earths spot planet.shape prints the same global
#   So global can be called when used as a method by the instance (earth)
#   OR the class (planet)

    This is a reference for anyone including myself to learn the ways of Python. I will add to it gradually, in a way that 
    makes sense to learn. Anyone else is invited to add to this, creating another class, instance or really anything, as long
    as the skill/knowledge level needed to complete or do is near the same as the content already posted. (this is also to 
    help myself understand class, functions, methods ect in Python as anything that starts with Def is the only thing I 
    seem to be struggleing with.
